Emerule Manor is a "Location Module" for the Foundry VTT system. This location module
is designed to depict the Emerule Manor in the Fethael Hundred of the Kingdom of Kaldor, on
the island of Hârn in the [HârnWorld](https://columbiagames.com/harnworld/) fantasy
setting; however, this manor could be adapted to exist anywhere in any fantasy setting.

Although designed for use with the [HârnMaster](https://foundryvtt.com/packages/hm3)
system, this module is mostly system-agnostic.  Detailed descriptions of the actors
has been provided in journal entries to facilitate conversion to other game systems.

Emerule is a sleepy manor on the edge of the Chyle forest, favored hunting lodge of
the Baron Indama, and home to the Baron's troblesome daughter. The manor has been
plagued by recent attacks from a local outlaw gang.
