{"_id":"1Q6PTMhAVORiOykX","name":"_Overview","content":"<p>Emerule is a \"Location Module\"; it is designed to depict the Emerule manor and village located in Fethael Hundred, Nephshire, kingdom of Kaldor, on the island of Hârn in the <a href=\"https://columbiagames.com/harnworld/\">HârnWorld fantasy setting</a>; however, this manor and village could be adapted to exist anywhere in any fantasy setting.</p>\n<p>This module is based on the Emerule manor article from \"<a href=\"https://www.lythia.com/fethael-hundred/manors.html\">Fethael Hundred Manors</a>\" fanon; please see @Compendium[hm-loc-emerule.journals.hDdG1O93oKOL3EJm]{Credits} for more information.</p>\n<p>This module details all of the households, including interior plans of the manor.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>Using this module with Non-HârnMaster systems</h2>\n<p>This entire module is system-agnostic.  See the section below on NPCs for details about the residents; these details may be used to generate appropriate statistics for your game system.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>Using the Scenes</h2>\n<p>A number of scenes are provided representing maps. These scenes depict both internal and external areas; internal areas are generally set at a 5-foot grid spacing, while exterior areas use much larger scaling. The following subsections describe some common elements of these scenes.</p>\n<h3>Map Notes</h3>\n<p>The scenes make extensive use of Map Notes to provide detailed description of important areas in the scenes. To view these map notes, click on the \"bookmark icon\" in the canvas toolbar. Map notes are not visible to players, only to the GM.</p>\n<h3>Text and Markings</h3>\n<p>In various areas text and or markings have been provided in the scenes to assist the GM. Generally this information is set to only be visible to the GM.</p>\n<h3>Stairs</h3>\n<p>Some stairs may have an arrow indicating the direction the stairs descend. When present these arrows are visible to all players.</p>\n<h3>Lighting</h3>\n<p>To control ambient lighting, use the \"darkness\" setting for the scene.</p>\n<p>All scenes have been setup with Unrestricted Vision Range enabled, with a Vision Limitation Threshold set to 0.7. This allows all areas of the scene to be lit during the day, but vision is limited and lights are required at night.</p>\n<p>Internal lamps and candle lights have been placed in indoor areas. These lights have been set to enable when the \"darkness\" setting is ≥ 0.2, that is, just after things start becoming dim.</p>\n<p>Hârn has a cool climate, so all fireplaces and braziers are constantly lit.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>Recommended Modules</h2>\n<p>The following modules, although not required, are highly recommended to enhance this module:</p>\n<p><strong>Compendium Folders: </strong>Due to the large number of journal entries in this module, these journal entries have been organized into sub-folders using Compendium Folders. If Compendium Folders is not used, these will all show up as a single long list of Journal Entries in the compendium. As long as you follow the links starting with the _Overview journal entry, it should not be necessary to navigate the compendium, but if you want to navigate through the Journal Entries yourself, having Compendium Folders will greately simplify this task.</p>\n<p><strong>Backgroundless Pins:</strong> The map note icons all have a dark grey background; with this module, that background disappears. This may increase your enjoyment of the maps.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>Background Information</h2>\n<p>For historical, political, and recent events, see @Compendium[hm-loc-emerule.journals.3ZEAWp89Q8kOOh4F]{Settlement Information}.</p>\n<p>For additional adventures in and around Emerule, see @Compendium[hm-loc-emerule.journals.tzURBjoTSgEUMK3F]{Adventure Hooks}.</p>\n<p>Emerule is the hunting lodge for the Indamas.  For details about the annual hunting gathering, see @Compendium[hm-loc-emerule.journals.Qr4YL55aQETbfirw]{Boar Hunting with the Indama Clan}.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>Village Details</h2>\n<p>The tiny manor sits on a small rise above the Omin River.

{"_id":"3ZEAWp89Q8kOOh4F","name":"Settlement Information","content":"<p><strong>Location:</strong> Fethael Hundred, Kaldor<br /><strong>Status:</strong> Manor<br /><strong>Government:</strong> Sir Marby Lournay<br /><strong>Liege:</strong> Sir Eadwin Lournay (Drilen)<br /><strong>Population:</strong> Village 72; Manor 15</p>\n<p>Emerule is a tiny manor, tucked under the eaves of the wooded mountains of the Chyle Forest. This quiet little hamlet is home to the hunting lodge of the Baron of Getha. For most of the year, nothing of note happens but the month of Savor sees many of the noblest families of the kingdom visiting the manor green as guests of the Baron for the Indama clan’s annual hunt.</p>\n<h2>History</h2>\n<p>Emerule was established to guard the crossing of the Omin River. At one time the manor was one of the hunting lodges of the King of Serelind. The manor passed to the Indama clan when they became Barons of Getha. In 573, the Baron gifted the lodge to the Lournay family in recognition of their long service, although the Baron retained the hunting and forest rights.</p>\n<h2>Government</h2>\n<p>Sir Marby Lournay is the bailiff of the manor and owes fealty to his older brother, Sir Eadwin, Lord of Drilen. The two brothers are very close and Sir Marby is completely loyal to his brother. He has little interaction with the Kobarneys of Hyzevel, having felt the sting of their polite snobbery once too often.</p>\n<p>Sir Marby runs the manor with a light hand. He prefers sitting in a saddle hunting to sitting in a chair listening to his peasants squabble, so he is happy that Taran Krandar, the Reeve, handles most of the minor disputes.</p>\n<h2>Economics</h2>\n<p>Most of the hard currency in the village comes from the Indama Clan’s annual hunt. Villagers call this ten-day period “the Big Hunt” and earn much needed money for marriages and extra livestock working for the noble guests. Always adept at sensing an opportunity for graft, the Reeve has a stranglehold on the jobs at the Hunt. Everyone knows that a discreet gift to Taran is the only way to work as a server during the meals or as a groom in the Hunt’s stable yard, both being the positions that earn the highest tips.</p>\n<p>Throughout the rest of the year, coin is earned from the export of Anderin the Charcoaler’s [7] wares to Drilen and from Sir Marby’s sale of wolf pelts in Ominstru. Varybis Haral (q.v. FHG.) periodically delivers manufactured items.</p>\n<h2>Religion</h2>\n<p>The religious climate of Emerule is similar to the rest of Kaldor. Sir Marby attends Laranian services at the Abbey at Lethyl. An Ebasethe visits from Hyzevel and holds Peonian rites for the villagers near the well.</p>\n<h2>Current Events</h2>\n<p>Lysella Indama came to live at Emerule in Savor 719 after her parents discovered that she had been having a romantic liaison with one of the Baron’s squires, Galdyk Onaret (see Getha 24). Faced with the horrifying possibility that Lysella might surrender her chastity before being properly wed, the Baron and Baroness arranged for the sixteen-year old daughter to stay at the family’s hunting lodge with her governess.</p>\n<p>Sir Marby has done all he can to make Lysella’s stay pleasant and, while the relationship between the two is cordial, each resents the other’s presence in “their” manor. Sir Marby can’t wait for “the brat” to get married so that he can see her off to her husband’s lands and get on with his life.</p>\n<p>For her part, Lady Lysella spends as much time as possible in Getha, even if this means being near her mother. She dislikes the rustic manor and vents her frustration on “the old fossil” of a Bailiff that her father “saddled her with.” The servants (especially Petry) always see her off when she leaves, eager to enjoy a respite from her sharp tongue and yelgri-like disposition.</p>","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"Rn9jkHilxPKp2kf5":3},"flags":{"entityorder":{"order":600000},"scene-packer":{"sourceId":"JournalEntry.1wM2wytXHeiCmRn7"},"cf":{"id":null,"path":"Emerule","color":"#000000"}}}

{"_id":"Qr4YL55aQETbfirw","name":"Boar Hunting with the Indama Clan","content":"<p>The manor hosts an annual boar hunt during a ten-day in Savor when the entire Indama clan and a number of their important guests descend on the little manor to chase the wild game that live in the hills surrounding the hamlet. While the deer are hunted on horseback with the help of beaters, the Baron insists that the boar be hunted on foot with spears and dogs. Only the hardiest hunters enjoy walking for hours in the cold, wet forest, waiting to see if a dangerous tusked beast will burst from the thick underbrush. Truth be told, there is as much eating and drinking as hunting during this period but the villagers and vassals spend many hours scouting the forest for game suitable for the spectacle.</p>\n<p>The small manor house is usually filled with the Baron and special guests so most of the hunt’s participants camp in the village green. The little settlement takes on a festive air as the rows between the pavilions are lit with torches and the musicians brought by the family from Gardiren and Bidow fill the night with song. Villagers often work for the hunt’s guests, as bearers and grooms, and this provides a valuable addition to their meager incomes.</p>\n<h2>The Schedule of the Hunt</h2>\n<p>Each day is divided into phases. The members of the hunt arise early, breakfasting in the gloom of pre-dawn as their grooms prepare weapons and horses. A quick prayer service is held (Sir Luisan Kelic, Reblena of Jenkald, always attends the Hunt and brings a chaplain with him) and, with a stirring horn cry, the group rides out into the forest.</p>\n<p>Since boars are hunted in thick forest with spears, the grooms make a small camp and picket the horses while the hunters and their hounds continue on foot. The huntsmen loose their dogs and the chase ranges far over hill and through dale. During this phase of the hunt, hunters become winded, have accidents while running through the underbrush, or even get lost.</p>\n<p>When the dogs flush a boar, the beast will either run or attack if cornered. A wild boar is a formidable opponent; dogs die as a matter of routine and it is not uncommon for a hunter to fall to the sharp tusks of the beast as well. It is considered polite to allow the highest ranking noble (the host or an honored guest) the first strike at the beast but, if the animal charges, it is best to strike hard and true.</p>\n<p>Once the beast is killed, the huntsmen butcher the carcass and feed the dogs while the hunters share a stirrup cup. The walk back to the horses is filled with stories and shared jests. Huntsmen drag the beast back to the manor house and drive the dogs back to their kennels.</p>\n<p>Each evening starts with a lavish meal, with dancing and singing afterwards. Because of the small size of the hunting lodge, most of the entertainment is staged in large pavilions that have been pitched in the village common. Characters can hone their skills at the art of courtly romance or indulge in the baser pleasures of the flesh in the shadows and amongst the tents that cover the common.</p>\n<h2>Participating in the Hunt</h2>\n<p>Peasants vie for the jobs that bring them into direct contact with the nobles. Yeomen are given the responsibility of leading the hounds or caring for the sites during the hunt. They know that the nobles often tip with silver pennies!</p>\n<p>Nobles will join the hunt. Invitations come from the Baron and he is not amused when uninvited persons appear. In addition to family members (all of whom are invited, without exception), Sir Chimin selects several “special guests” to be the center of the hunt’s social activities. Previous guests have included the Earl of Neph, the Sheriff of Thel, and the Rekela of Brynd. In 720, Sir Chimin has invited the Earl of Vemion and his son as part of a plan to arrange a marriage between Sir Urian Caldeth and Lady Lysella Indama.</p>\n<h2>Other Activities during the Hunt</h2>\n<h3>The Day Before the Hunt (10 Savor)</h3>\n<p>The participants of the hunt attend the Feast of Saint Syrele at Lethyl Abbey. The huntsmen scout the woods one final time for game and finalize preparations at the sites for luncheons, often positioning large heavy items for later use.</p>\n<h3>Day 1 (11 Savor)</h3>\n<p>The participants ride to Emerule in the morning. After a light lunch while the servants pitch tents and unpack, the nobles “ride the ground” with Sir Chimin and take note of the hunting areas that have been scouted.</p>\n<h3>Days 2 – 4 (12 – 14 Savor)</h3>\n<p>These days are devoted to the boar hunt. While the men hunt boar, the ladies hawk for ducks or heron along the river. The ladies strike out in a different direction each day. Over the last ten years, a tradition has grown of taking luncheon with Lady Tommasina Lournay at the manor of Drilen on 14 Savor.</p>\n<h3>Day 5 (15 Savor)</h3>\n<p>It is customary that one of the clerics holds Soratir in the morning. In the years before his unexpected death, the Rekela of Nurez celebrated Soratir in the village green and gave thanks for the good hunting and the lack of casualties among man, horse, and hound. Since the Rekela’s death in 714, this duty has fallen to the most senior cleric at the hunt; usually the chaplain of Getha or Jenkald but occasionally the Serolan of Lethyl will offer the service.</p>\n<p>Because the hunt starts too late in the morning to hunt boar, this is generally taken as a day of rest. Lords escort their ladies for a day of hawking along the river. Sir Marby hangs a scarecrow from a tall oak branch along the Ominstru Road and knights lie in the shade chatting and waiting their turn to tilt at the swinging target.</p>\n<h3>Day 6 – 8 (16 – 18 Savor)</h3>\n<p>The die-hard hunters continue their pursuit of boar in the woods south of the manor while other knights take the ladies and ride after deer in the woods to the west toward Ominstru. Sir Marby always accompanies the deer hunters, as he is charged with ensuring that no one chases game across the Kobarney family lands and causes an incident, as happened in 715.</p>\n<h3>Day 9 (19 Savor)</h3>\n<p>The Farewell Feast is held this evening. In preparation for the annual hunt, Sir Marby orders a bullock from Getha. The animal is kept just in case the hunting is poor and the kitchens need meat to supplement the catch. Sir Marby is always very proud when he can introduce the last night’s dinner with the cry, “M’Lord, dinner is served and the bullock is safe in his byre!” meaning that the hunting was good enough that they didn’t need to slaughter it. Baron Chimin’s father found this custom amusing and allowed Sir Marby to keep the bullock, which is slaughtered and shared amongst those villagers that helped with the hunt.</p>\n<h3>Day 10 (20 Savor)</h3>\n<p>After a light meal, most of the hunt’s participants depart Emerule.</p>","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"Rn9jkHilxPKp2kf5":3},"flags":{"entityorder":{"order":1800000},"scene-packer":{"sourceId":"JournalEntry.lQq2p8Bt294mLMmd"},"cf":{"id":null,"path":"Emerule","color":"#000000"}}}
