She is voluptuous and fair skinned with dark hair. Her eyes are striking. They are light brown, some might say golden, a family trait. Thoroughly imbued with tales of chivalric romance, she is in love with being in love. She dreams of being swept off her feet by a dashing knight who will take her to a beautiful manor draped with roses and sweet alyssum.</p>\n<p>She feels that Galdyk is her prince charming. He is a poet, a warrior, and has the strength to stand up to her father. She wants to run away with Galdyk and live her dream. The hard life of a bandit chieftain’s woman has never entered her mind and she might have second thoughts if her dream house turnsed out to be a musty cave in the wilderness.</p>",
